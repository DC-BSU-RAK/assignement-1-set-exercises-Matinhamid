        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            "The Good Place" is an American fantasy comedy television series created by Michael Schur. The show follows Eleanor Shellstrop, a woman who wakes up in the afterlife and is introduced by Michael to "the Good Place," a highly selective heaven-like utopia designed by him as a reward for her righteous life. However, she quickly realizes that she was sent there by mistake. With the help of her assigned soulmate Chidi Anagonye, she attempts to become a better person to avoid being discovered and sent to "the Bad Place." The series explores themes of ethics, morality, and what it truly means to be a good person.
